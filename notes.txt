day 0
read assignment and poke around a bit looking at APIs, cloud solutions, etc.

day 1
goal: get working dummy flask app
mkvirtualenv /ws/projects/animalia
fork rafastealth/animalia repo
checkout jpowerwa/animalia repo
> pip install flask, flask-mysql
src/app.py
src/templates/*.html
src/static/*.css

day 2
goal: get request/response end-to-end locally, including ORM layer
convert dummy flask app to use JSON request
read wit.ai docs. I don't get it.

day 3
goal: figure out wit.ai
start playing with wit.ai by creating test app. I sort of get it.
documentation at wit.ai is very confusing. This page is the most helpful that I have found so far: https://wit.ai/docs/console/complete-guide
> sudo apt-get install libsox-dev
> pip install wit
Helped to write driver script submitting queries to trained app using wit.text_query method.
Studied training data; very informative in determining data model for animal facts.
To consider: 
Q: Should application attempt to handle new kinds of relationships from wit? 
Q: What is the simplest interesting set of functionality that I can build?

day 4
goal: end-to-end naive implementation of Add Fact API
pip install flask-sqlalchemy
Got Concept and ConceptType declarative classes working with relationship.



points of confusion
1. wit.ai: hard to find description of its general model; confusing that demo emphasis is on voice; would be nice to see set of intents defined in trained wit application.
2. animalia_data.csv: what is this for? To use to generate sentences to submit to my implementation of the animal fact api? To seed the database? Looks like a dump of a database used by the animalia app. Confusing but informative: insect is listed as species but in data it is food and species. Ended up being a great resource for determining the animalia data model. Example shows "bear" included in answer to "Which animals eat mammals, but this is not represented in the training data."
3: If set_animal_fact is called with sentence that results in same fact as another sentence, return new id or original fact id? A: original fact id. Note: be careful when deleting facts. If any submitted fact is still around, do not delete data.
